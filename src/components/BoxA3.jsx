            <p>Currently, I’m studying Informatics at 
            <span className="highlighted-text"> Ionian University </span> 
            <span className="italic-text">(yep, on an island—definitely a unique experience!)</span>. I’ll just say it’s a bit quiet here, and sometimes I miss having a vibrant scene
            <span className="italic-text"> to drown my sorrows in when my code decides to break for no reason</span>.
        </p>
        <p> 
            While juggling my studies, I also work for the Director of the ENT Clinic at the University Hospital of Ioannina 
            and Professor at the Univesity of Ioannina, 
            where I am responsible for making his website.  
            <span className='italic-text'> He treats patients and runs the place; I treat bugs and run his digital place</span>.
